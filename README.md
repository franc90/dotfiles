If you look for inspiration, I'd recommend using 
[awesome-dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles), 
especially dotfiles by:
* [rootbeersoup](https://github.com/rootbeersoup/dotfiles)
* [webpro](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles)
* [thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles)  

(there are more but I am both too lazy and incompetent to find them all)
